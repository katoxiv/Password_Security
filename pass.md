# Password Strength Checker Documentation

## Overview
This script implements a robust password strength checker that evaluates passwords based on various criteria including length, character types, patterns, and common words. It uses both custom checks and the `zxcvbn` library for comprehensive strength assessment.

## Features
1. Check password length
2. Verify presence of lowercase letters, uppercase letters, digits, and special characters
3. Detect repeated characters
4. Check for common dictionary words
5. Identify easily guessable patterns
6. Utilize `zxcvbn` for advanced strength scoring

## Implementation Details

### Dependencies
- `re`: Built-in Python library for regular expressions
- `zxcvbn`: External library for estimating password strength

### Main Components

#### Class: PasswordStrengthChecker

##### Constructor: `__init__`
- Parameters:
  - `min_length` (default: 8): Minimum required password length
  - `special_chars` (default: "!@#$%^&*()-_=+[]{}|;:,.<>?/"): String of special characters to check for
  - `dict_file` (default: None): Path to a file containing common words

##### Method: `contains_dictionary_word`
- Checks if the password contains any common dictionary word
- Returns: Boolean (True if found, False otherwise)

##### Method: `contains_easy_pattern`
- Checks for easily guessable patterns (e.g., "abcd", "1234")
- Returns: Boolean (True if pattern found, False otherwise)

##### Method: `check_password_strength`
- Main method for evaluating password strength
- Checks:
  1. Password length
  2. Presence of lowercase letter, uppercase letter, digit, and special character
  3. Repeated characters (more than twice consecutively)
  4. Common dictionary words
  5. Easily guessable patterns
  6. `zxcvbn` score (should be at least 3 out of 4)
- Returns: Tuple (Boolean indicating if password is strong, String message explaining the result)

### Usage
1. Create an instance of `PasswordStrengthChecker`, optionally specifying a dictionary file path
2. Prompt user for a password
3. Call `check_password_strength` with the entered password
4. Print the result, indicating whether the password is strong and why

## Example Usage

```python
checker = PasswordStrengthChecker(dict_file="path_to_dictionary.txt")
password = input("Enter a password to check: ")
is_strong, message = checker.check_password_strength(password)
print(f"Password is {'strong' if is_strong else 'weak'}: {message}")
```

## Considerations and Limitations
- The effectiveness of the dictionary word check depends on the comprehensiveness of the provided dictionary file
- The `zxcvbn` library provides a more nuanced strength assessment but may have its own limitations
- This checker provides a good baseline for password strength but should not be considered foolproof for high-security applications
- The script does not store or transmit passwords; all checks are performed locally

## Future Improvements
- Implement more sophisticated pattern recognition
- Add options for custom strength criteria
- Provide more detailed feedback on how to improve weak passwords
- Integrate with a password manager or security system

Remember to install the `zxcvbn` library using pip:
```
pip install zxcvbn
```

Note: Replace "path_to_dictionary.txt" with the actual path to your dictionary file if you choose to use that feature.
